 The inheritance principle allows us to reuse code by creating new classes that inherit from existing classes.

 The polymorphism principle allows different types of objects to behave differently depending on their type.
 
 In this application, the Vehicle class is an abstract class that defines the common properties and methods of all vehicles.
 
 The Car class and the Motorcycle class inherit from the Vehicle class, and they can each add their own specific properties and methods.
 
 The startEngine() method is defined in the Vehicle class, but the Car class and the Motorcycle class can override the startEngine() method to provide their own implementation of the method.
